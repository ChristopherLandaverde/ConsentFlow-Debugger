## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Current Workflow with CI/CD

```bash
# 1. Start development
npm run dev

# 2. Make changes and test locally
# Chrome: chrome://extensions/ → Load unpacked → Reload

# 3. Run local validation
npm run validate

# 4. Commit and push (triggers CI/CD)
git add .
git commit -m "Feature: description"
git push

# 5. CI/CD automatically:
# - Validates architecture integrity
# - Runs integration tests
# - Checks code quality
# - Reports any issues
```

### Quality Gates
- ✅ **Architecture Validation**: Ensures message passing integrity
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: Validates cross-component communication
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Automated linting and validation
- ✅ **Manual Testing**: Local extension testing required

### Emergency Procedures
- **Rollback**: `git revert <commit-hash>` for quick fixes
- **Hotfix**: Create hotfix branch for critical issues
- **Validation**: Run `npm run validate` before any deployment
